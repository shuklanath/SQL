The company has many different locations and has been recording the sales of different locations on various products. You, their new data scientist, have been tasked with the question: *What are our best products and salespeople, and how can we use this information to improve our overall performance?*\n\nYou have been given access to the relevant data files with documentation from the IT department. Your job is to extract meaningful insights from these data files to help increase sales. First, you will look at the best products and try to see how different products perform in different categories. Second, you will analyze the best salespeople to see if the commission percentage motivates them to sell more.\n\n**Business Problem.** Your task is to *write queries in SQL to carry out the requested analysis*.\n\n**Analytical Context.** You are given the data as an SQLite database. The company has been pretty vague about how they expect you to extract insights, but you have come up with the following plan of attack:\n\n1. Load the database and ensure you can run basic queries against it\n2. Look at how product ratings and total sales are related\n3. See how products sell in different subcategories (bikes, helmets, socks, etc.)\n4. Calculate which salespeople performed the best in 2014\n5. See if total sales are correlated with commission percentage\n\nOf course, this is only your initial plan. As you explore the database, your strategy will likely change.",

If it is positive, the relationship is positive. If it is negative, the relationship is negative.

This is why you had to work with the `culture` value before getting the English language descriptions. The problem is you are now told the sales are recorded in *local* currency, so your previous analyses are flawed. Technically, you must convert all amounts to USD if you wish to compare the different salespeople fairly! Instead, let's group the salespeople orders by the currency used for each order (you will have to consider `tocurrencyrate` for this task in the `CurrencyRate` table). \n\n#### 8.1 (1 point)\n\nLet's explore the currencies in different sales. But first, here are some things to understand about the currency columns:\n* The **`FromCurrencyCode`** is all USD, so focus on **`toCurrencyRate`**\n* If the sale was paid in USD, the **`currencyRateID`** was left blank (since there was no need to make a conversion)\n\nCreate a table with the **`salesPersonID`**, **`salesOrderID`**, **`CurrencyRateID`** and **`toCurrencyCode`** to see the connection. Remember to exclude sales that are not associated with a salesperson and only consider sales in 2014. Order by the salesperson ID and show only 10 rows. \n\nHere is a visual of the tables and columns that you will be working with. <br>\n\n![EC4 Exercise 8.1 - Tables](data/images/EC4_Exercise8-1_Visual.JPG)+\n\n<br>\n\n**Additional Hints**\n* Since **`USD`** would not show up in the **`CurrencyRate`** table, you will have to do a **`LEFT JOIN`** to avoid losing information. \n* Be sure that you understand how the content of the **`CurrencyRate`** table is read and what each column means.\n* Use additional cells to experiment if needed.\n* The **`None`** in the above example takes the place of **`NULL`** values, which contextually means that the sale was in USD. \n\n<br>\n\nYour table should look like this:\n\n| salespersonid | salesorderid | currencyrateid | tocurrencycode |\n|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 274           | 65294        | None           | None           |\n| 274           | 65298        | None           | None           |\n| 274           | 67277        | None           | None           |\n| 274           | 67286        | 11427          | CAD            |\n| 274           | 69528        | None           | None           |\n| …             | …            | …              | …              |\n\n\n",
